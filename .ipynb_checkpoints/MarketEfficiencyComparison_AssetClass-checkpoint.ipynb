    "# Quantifying Market Efficiency: A Python & Machine Learning Approach Across Asset Classes #\n",

    "<Something about highlightlighting Bloomberg API, the package. Not to put down BQUANT>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the vast expanse of the financial universe, every asset class pulses with its own unique heartbeat, charting stories molded by economic dynamics, investor sentiments, geopolitical influences, and a plethora of factors that dictate global finance. From the frenetic pace of US equities, to the steady income of corporate bonds and the vast landscapes of foregin stock markets - each weaves tales of synchronicity, divergence, opportunity, and chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the majority of my career, I have worked closely with portfolio managers and analysts on both the fixed income and equity sides of the isle. Conversations in research meetings, risk management reviews and marketing pitches consistently revolved around trading relative value within a firm's capital structure to seize alpha. It was a dance of navigating from high yield bonds at the top, right down to the equity, suggesting potential inefficiencies along the way. But where was the quantitative proof? Over time, this lingering curiosity has grown into a broader quest: Do market efficiencies truly differ across major asset classes? And if so, could machine learning help us unearth, quantify, and then exploit these inefficiencies?\n",
    "\n",
    "While the corridors of academia are lined with theses on this subject, my aim is to combine the analytical prowess of machine learning with my industry insights to unravel this enigma. This will not be a perfect study - I take assumptions, there will be oversights, but this is a starting point rather than a conclusive statement. Feedback, as always, is a gift.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections we delve into historical return profiles, intricacies of market efficiency, its layers, and its significance in the sphere of active management. Leveraging various python libraries and the Bloomberg Professional Service, we'll dissect asset classes, zero in on company-specific instances, and navigate the potentials of machine learning-driven investment strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that these views are personal, and as history has often demonstrated, past performance seldom guarantees future results."

Delving into the return distributions of these asset classes, we see distinct patterns hinting at potential inefficiencies.\n",

On the contrast, asset classes like **US Large Cap Equities, US Small Cap Equities, and Emerging Market Equities** have milder skewness and kurtosis values and thus resemble a more normal distributions.\n",

    "The weak form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) posits that current asset prices fully incorporate all available historical information, primarily past prices. Hence, investors shouldn't be able to consistently earn above-average returns using historical data alone. In this context, if an asset class's returns display significant autocorrelation (i.e. if points are above the blue shaded regions in below graphs), it could indicate that past returns have some predictive power over future returns.

    "#### Weak Form Findings\n",
    "Diving into the autocorrelation of asset class returns offers intriguing insights. **US Large Cap and Small Cap Equities** both show initial mean reversion tendencies with their pronounced negative autocorrelation at the first lag. **US Investment Grade Bonds** differ, hinting at potential momentum with positive initial lags. The momentum is also evident in **US High Yield Bonds and US Bank Loans**, where the persistence of positive autocorrelation across several lags suggests potential inefficiencies or return predictability. Meanwhile, **Developed Country Equities** and **Emerging Market Equities** present a mixed interplay of market dynamics, revealing potential inefficiencies in their patterns. **Emerging Market Debt**, much like the **High Yield Bonds**, also suggests momentum, especially in the initial lags. \n",

    "The semi-strong form of market efficiency asserts that asset prices adjust rapidly to all publicly available information (green line below) and are unpredictable (i.e. a random walk), so neither technical analysis nor fundamental analysis can consistently achieve superior returns. If markets are semi-stong inefficient, prices will adjust gradually and should be more predictable."

    "\n",
    "To examine the semi-strong form of the EMH, I used an XGBoost classifier—a very popular gradient boosting framework - because of its versatility and transparency. The essence of our test: If the models, trained on historical technical indicators, can consistently predict post-event returns with an accuracy significantly greater than 50%, it implies that the asset class doesn't rapidly incorporate event-related data, challenging the semi-strong form of EMH. Conversely, an accuracy close to or below 50% would suggest that post-event returns are seemingly random after accounting for known event information, supporting the semi-strong form.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was split into 'event' and 'non-event' periods. Models were trained for each respective asset class (8 total) on the 'non-event' days and put to the test on the 'event' days, mimicking a real-world scenario where investors aim to exploit new public data. Below is an interactive summary of the periods. The 'event days' are a 30 day window following the announcement of a event (see reference table below chart for expect starts). "

    " I constructed a number of trailing technical features from the historical price data of the asset classes. These are the independent variables. For the targets, or dependent variables, I used the next day (t+1) returns of the respective indexes. Below are the descriptions of each.\n",
    " \n",
    "<u>**Dependent Variables**</u>\n",
    "- **SMA (Simple Moving Average):** The average price of an n asset over a specific number of days. It's \"simple\" because each day's price has equal weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **EMA (Exponential Moving Average):** Similar to SMA, but it gives more weight to recent prices. This responsiveness means EMA reacts more quickly to price changes than SMA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** A momentum oscillator ranging from 0 to 100, indicating the speed and change of price movements. Typically, an RSI above 70 suggests an asset might be overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests it might be oversold.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):** A trend-following momentum indicator, represented by the difference between a short-term EMA and a long-term EMA. MACD signals are typically derived from its crossovers with its signal line (an EMA of the MACD itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Targets/Dependent Variables**</u>\n",
    "- **Next Day Returns:** The target variables are the next day (t+1) returns of the respective indexes. I chose to use future returns versus prices because predicting returns is more feasible; returns capture relative changes and inherent volatility, providing clearer insight into an asset's dynamic behavior. Next, I transformed the returns into binary variables: '1' for a positive return and '0' for a negative return. By converting continuous next-day returns into binary indicators, we focus on predicting directional trends rather than exact magnitudes, simplifying the modeling process and reducing noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Evaluation**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate the models at T+5 days, T+30 days, T+60 days and T+90 days. By testing the model's performance across varying time periods after an event, I am examining the speed at which new information is incorporated into prices across different asset classes. If a model consistently generates accurate predictions greater than 50% long after an event, it could indicate inefficiencies in the market or that the market is taking longer to assimilate the new information, which would challenge the semi-strong form of the EMH.\n",
    "\n",
    "In evaluating the models across different time periods, the primary metric of interest remains the F1 Score. This metric becomes especially significant in contexts like financial trading where both types of errors – false positives (erroneously buying) and false negatives (missing out on a genuine buying opportunity) – are financially penalizing. The F1 Score serves as an optimal metric because it is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, ensuring that a model not only provides trustworthy positive predictions (signifying high precision) but also efficiently identifies the majority of genuine positive opportunities (indicating high recall). \n",
    "\n",
    "While we have multiple metrics at our disposal, the dynamic nature of financial markets necessitates the exploration of models across varied time frames. This is crucial as different periods might unveil diverse patterns or anomalies. By identifying the top-performing model across the most relevant time frame for our strong form tests, we're better positioned to harness potential market efficiencies or pinpoint areas of exploitability."

However, **US High Yield Bonds and US Bank Loans, displaying scores like 0.62 and 0.75, respectively, over a 90-day period, reinforce the earlier observation of stronger pattern recognition capabilities. These scores, being considerably above the 0.5 mark, suggest potential inefficiencies in these markets.

Yet, the intricate temporal dynamics and complex non-linearities inherent in financial data exposed its limitations. Financial markets, with their multifaceted interactions and time-sensitive structures, demand models that can capture depth and complexity. Enter Keras deep learning models. These models, equipped with capabilities to automatically discern crucial features, adeptly handle sequential data, and intricately model inter-variable relationships, emerged as a more suitable choice. This shift from XGBoost to a Keras-based approach underscores the criticality of aligning the modeling tool with the complexities of the task, especially in the enigmatic realm of finance. \n",

If this adapted model also performs well on other asset classes, it might suggest that certain information is consistently not being incorporated across multiple asset classes."

    "## Deeper Dive into Potential Inefficiencies\n",
    "\n",
    "### US High Yield Bonds:\n",
    "- **Market Composition**: This market consists of companies that are more susceptible to economic downturns and have higher default rates. As a result, behavioral biases might play a role, with investors reacting emotionally to news, thereby creating momentum in returns.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Liquidity**: High yield bonds are generally less liquid than investment-grade bonds. Less liquidity can lead to price discrepancies and create short-term momentum as prices adjust to new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### US Equities:\n",
    "- **Market Dynamics**: Given the vast diversity of the US equities market, different sectors may respond differently to macroeconomic changes, leading to potential mean reversion as sectors cycle through periods of outperformance and underperformance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Information Flow**: The sheer volume of news and data available can sometimes lead to overreactions, causing short-term inefficiencies which later correct, leading to mean reversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### US Leveraged Loans:\n",
    "- **Credit Risks**: Leveraged loans are typically extended to entities with lower credit ratings, meaning they're riskier. This heightened risk can introduce pricing inefficiencies as investors constantly reassess default probabilities.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Covenant Structures**: Leveraged loans often come with specific covenants that can influence the loan's risk profile. Changes or breaches in these covenants can lead to pricing discrepancies as the market reacts.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Secondary Market Dynamics**: Leveraged loans are traded in secondary markets which can be less liquid than traditional bond markets. This illiquidity can lead to temporary price inefficiencies.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Economic Sensitivity**: Companies that take on leveraged loans are often more sensitive to economic downturns. As a result, any potential economic disruptions can lead to sharper price adjustments in this market compared to more stable debt instruments.\n",
    "### Oil:\n",
    "- **Geopolitical Factors**: The oil market is greatly influenced by geopolitical events. Supply disruptions, conflicts, and OPEC decisions can introduce short-term momentum or mean reversion tendencies.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Supply/Demand Dynamics**: The oil market can often overreact to perceived shifts in supply or demand, leading to inefficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### US Real Estate:\n",
    "- **Illiquidity**: Real estate is inherently less liquid than stocks or bonds. This illiquidity can lead to inefficiencies, especially during periods of economic stress when sellers might need to offload properties at sub-optimal prices.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Information Asymmetry**: Real estate markets often suffer from information asymmetry where buyers and sellers have different levels of information about a property. This can lead to inefficiencies in pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the underlying reasons for inefficiencies, investors can make more informed decisions and potentially capitalize on temporary market dislocations.\n"

    "### Not Scaling Explanation\n",
    "XGBoost, like many tree-based algorithms, is invariant to the scale of numerical features. This means that scaling the input features generally doesn't impact the predictive power of the model. Here's an explanation of why XGBoost might perform better without scaling and why one might choose to leave them unscaled:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Tree-based models, such as XGBoost, split the data based on feature values, seeking to differentiate the target variable regardless of the actual scale of the data. Thus, whether a feature's value is in the range of 0 to 1 or 0 to 1,000 doesn't fundamentally change the decision-making process of the tree. In contrast, algorithms that rely on distances between data points, like k-means clustering or k-nearest neighbors, or models that assume a certain distribution or scale, like linear regression, often benefit significantly from scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, XGBoost performed better without scaling. This could be due to several reasons. First, the raw values might carry intrinsic information that's somehow lost or muddled during scaling. Second, any small noise or variance in the scaled data can be amplified, potentially introducing inconsistencies in the model's predictions. Lastly, not scaling ensures that our model's outputs and feature importance values are interpretable in their original units, which can be advantageous when explaining results to stakeholders or making real-world decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the superior performance and interpretability advantages, we chose to leave the features unscaled for our XGBoost model.\"\n",
