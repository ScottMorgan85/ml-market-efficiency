I have a dataframe of daily returns already (see below) for 4/3/2007 - 8/18/2023 and a dataframe of events. Write the python code to built, test , evaluate performance of models for each asset class. Should I train an XGBoost model on each column exlcuding time periods around the event days, and then use those periods for my test and evaluation set? With these results could I conclude if these markets are semi-strong efficient?
